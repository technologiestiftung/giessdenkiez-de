Our urban trees are drying out and suffering long-term damage: In recent years, more and more trees had to be felled and their lifespan is decreasing. The public is now regularly called upon for support, but in a so far uncoordinated manner. Through this project we want to improve this and enable coordinated citizen participation in the watering of urban green spaces.`,

				"Based on the active exchange in our Slack community as well as your feedback via email and telephone, we have created a small FAQ. The most frequently asked questions are answered here.",
			qa: [
				{
					question: "How can I participate?",
					answer: `Explore:

Curious which tree is in front of your door? Our interactive map visualizes over 800,000 street trees of Berlin. If you want to find out more about a tree, navigate and zoom to the desired location and click on the colored dot. You will now see a lot of information about the selected tree.

Watering and adopting trees:


Do you want to get active or are you already actively watering? On Gieß den Kiez, you can enter when and with how much water you watered a tree. Trees can also be adopted. The adopted trees appear in your own user profile and can be found more quickly. This allows other neighbors in the area to see which trees need their attention. To water and adopt trees, first create a profile with a valid email address and then log in.

Connect:
          
You can use our public [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/giessdenkiez/shared_invite/zt-e3et281u-xON4UmBZpKavzDRkw5HmCQ) to exchange ideas with others, report defective pumps in your neighborhood or connect to jointly water your neighborhood.`,
				},
				{
					question: "What can I do if trees are not registered correctly?",
					answer: `We obtain the tree data set with all attributes such as address, tree species and planting year for each tree from the geoportal of the city of Berlin, the FIS broker. The tree register provided in the geoportal is based on the district-aggregated data from the road and green space authorities. It can therefore happen that data from trees is out of date or that properties differ from current reality. Unfortunately, we cannot make any changes to the tree register ourselves. Any deviations can only be reported directly to the responsible district authority. Once a year, the green space authorities publish an updated tree register, which we link to Gieß den Kiez after publication.`,
				},
				{
					question: "Why should I take action and water trees?",
					answer: `The long periods of drought and heat of the last two years have caused immense damage to Berlin's urban greenery. Between 2018 and 2019 alone, over 7,000 trees had to be felled, not solely due to drought damage.

The street and green space authorities are already active, but cannot keep up with the watering during Berlin's hot summers. Since the green space authorities are organized by district, each district works slightly different, which makes holistic and needs-based coordination difficult. Through the platform, we would like to give citizens the opportunity to help trees specifically based on their current water supply and to obtain further information. The goal is to save as many trees as possible through neighborly involvement.`,
				},
				{
					question: "How do I water correctly?",
					answer: `Depending on their age, location and tree species, trees need different amounts of water. Young trees (0-15 years) need more water than medium-aged trees (15-40 years). Old trees (40 years and older) are usually completely self-sufficient. 
          
Since freshly planted trees up to the age of three are usually supplied with water by the district parks authorities, the trees between four and 15 years in particular need our attention and our water.
          
Based on the Berlin [Manual Good Care](https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/natur-und-gruen/stadtgruen/pflegen-und-unterhalten/katalog-good-care/), we recommend you to water rarely, but rather with a larger amount of water. The manual recommends up to 200l per watering for freshly planted trees. In this way, you ensure that the soil moisture is increased even at depth. In the end, even smaller amounts do not hurt, especially in midsummer. It is important to loosen the dried out soil before watering so that the water can penetrate into the soil and does not run off above ground or accumulate incorrectly. So-called watering bags are also recommended, from which the water only emerges very slowly, hardly runs off the surface and therefore continuously seeps into the ground.`,
				},
				{
					question: "Who can I contact if pumps are broken or damaged?",
					answer: `The respective district roads and green spaces authorities are responsible for the infrastructure of the roads, which also includes the public hand pumps. If pumps are broken or damaged, the need for repairs can be reported there. We load the locations of the pumps on the map weekly from the Open Street Map database. If you want to help improve the data, for example by reporting a defective pump, you can do so in our [Slack Channel #pump-report](https://app.slack.com/client/T012K4SDYBY/C019SJQDPL7). The OSM community then has the opportunity to enter your information into the database.`,
				},
				{
					question: "How are technical problems handled?",
					answer: `The participation platform “Gieß den Kiez” is a prototype and therefore a beta version of a web app. We are aware of some technical hurdles, but depend on your help. We are happy to receive your technical feedback and questions in our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/giessdenkiez/shared_invite/zt-e3et281u-xON4UmBZpKavzDRkw5HmCQ) or by email. Anyone who feels at home in the “tech world” is welcome to participate in our [Open Source GitHub Repository](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/giessdenkiez-de) invited and can comment on his issues or code fixes directly in the repository.`,
				},
				{
					question: "Why is the website not loading or loading very slowly?",
					answer: `When the page is first opened, the browser loads over 800,000 data points - this can take a while! Regardless, there may be slightly different displays when using different browsers. For the best experience, we recommend using Chrome or Firefox Desktop. Experience has shown that the most common problems can be solved if the browser is not outdated or the latest version is installed and there is a stable internet connection (LAN or WLAN). 
          
Use via smartphone (mobile network) can lead to performance problems (page loads slowly). If problems occur repeatedly, you can report them in our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/giessdenkiez/shared_invite/zt-e3et281u-xON4UmBZpKavzDRkw5HmCQ), Report by email or via GitHub Issue, stating the device used, the operating system, the browser and the browser version.`,
				},
				{
					question: "What should I do if I watered a tree incorrectly?",
					answer: `To remove a watering entry first click on the tree for which you entered the watering. Scroll down the tree sidebar to the section of past waterings, click the trash can icon next to the entry you want to delete, and click “Delete” to confirm. Only waterings that you have made yourself can be deleted. After deleting, enter the watering with the correct information (number of liters and time) via the "I watered" button.`,
				},
				{
					question: "Can the principle be transferred to other cities?",
					answer: `The “Gieß den Kiez” platform is an open source software project and runs under an MIT license. Accordingly, the idea and also the source code can be used and further developed free of charge for implementation in other cities. If you are interested, please take a look at our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/giessdenkiez-de) or contact us via email. We are also happy to support your city with the technical implementation via [DeineStadtgießt](https://deinestadt.giessdenkiez.de/).`,
				},
				{
					question: "I still have a question!",
					answer: `The FAQ couldn't help you or you have a more complex query? Then write us an [Email](mailto:giessdenkiez@citylab-berlin.org).`,
				},
				{
					question: "Why aren't all of Berlin's trees shown?",
					answer: `Gieß den Kiez is based on the tree register. The tree register is a city directory in which (city/street or park) trees are managed and which is provided by the street and green spaces authorities. However, the green space authorities are not responsible for all of Berlin's trees. The trees in the Plänterwald, for example, are subject to the forestry office. These trees therefore do not appear in Gieß den Kiez.`,
